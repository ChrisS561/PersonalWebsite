									Python Wikipedia Language Influence for Programming Languages

									the frequency of language links and plotting the most
									influential ones, I gained valuable experience in working with
									APIs and data analysis. This project showcases my skills in
									Python programming and data analysis.

									Prolog Tetris Board Solver for Programming Languages
								</CardSubtitle>
								<CardText>
									This Prolog Tetris Board Solver project showcases the
									backtracking capabilities of Prolog and its ability to find
									all possible solutions for a given board size and set of
									parts. We created a predicate called shape_fits to check if a
									shape would fit into the grid, breaking it down into a 1D list
									of blocks and checking the grid at each step using multiple
									predicates.

									Haskell L-Systems for Programming Languages
								</CardSubtitle>
								<CardText>
									This project explores L-Systems and Fractals in Haskell,
									demonstrating the importance of recursion in Haskell's
									recursive nature. The code uses grammatical systems to
									generate new sentences by iteratively re-writing a given
									sentence as a group of symbols, and defines the L systems
									axiom, symbols, and production. With this program, I was able
									to create fractals, including the LÃ©vy curve, and the included
									commands file provided guidelines and error messages.
